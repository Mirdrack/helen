# Hellen 
This code is for monitoring temperature and humidity with an *Arduino*

#### About the structure of the project
The project requires a copy of the **ino** file and one copy of each thirdparty libary used on the project in the *src* folder in order to allow the [Ino Tool](https://github.com/amperka/ino) upload the **ino** file to the *Arduino* through the command line, this allows remote updates for the arduino program 

## To do's
* Build a script to copy the updated code from the main folder to the *src* before perform *Github* commit, at this moment this needs to be do it manually
* Clean the code and covert the braquets to the clemente's standard
* Code a function to manage the serial ouputs, maybe this could be the idea to build a library
